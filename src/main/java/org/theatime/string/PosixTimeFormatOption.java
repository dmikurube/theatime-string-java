     * <p>Otherwise, if this option is not specified, the plus-sign character ({@code '+'}) is recognized as
     * an optional flag to specify that the character used as the padding character is {@code '0'}, and that
     * if and only if the field being produced consumes more than four bytes to represent a year (for
     * {@code %F}, {@code %G}, or {@code %Y}) or more than two bytes to represent the year divided by 100
     * (for {@code %C}) then a leading plus-sign character shall be included if the year being processed is
     * greater than or equal to zero or a leading hyphen-minus character ({@code '-'}) shall be included if
     * the year is less than zero.
     *
     * <p>Recent standards and implementations adopts the option to recognize the plus-sign character as an
     * optional flag, such as POSIX (The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7), and glibc2.
     *
     * <p>The other option to recognize the plus-sign character as a terminating conversion specifier is
     * considered old. But, some processors still adopts the option, such as Ruby's {@code Date.strftime}.
